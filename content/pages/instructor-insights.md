## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _21L.703 Studies in Drama: Stoppard and Company_ as it was taught by professor Diana Henderson in Spring 2014.

This course is an intensive study of the works of one of Britain’s most respected, prolific and funny dramatists, Sir Tom Stoppard, and some of his contemporaries. It explores a wide range of knowledge in fields of math, philosophy, politics, history and art in order to think about the medium of drama as well as one writer’s work in depth. We analyze how drama connects with both the culture it represents and that which it addresses in performance.
